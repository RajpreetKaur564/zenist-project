            </div>
            <p>For any company, solid financial management practices are necessary to ensure profitability. As a business owner, where should you focus your efforts- on client deliverables, or on managing your revenue well? Outsourcing CFO services could be a solution to that issue.<br><br>
                A Virtual CFO can provide the level of expertise you need as a part-time contracted resource. Virtual CFOs will work with you to manage and build your business by ensuring that your financial resources are well managed and available when you need them.<br><br>
                The myths prevailing in the Indian markets often restrict the Start-up or SME organizations to have a Virtual service provider. Here are the rationales who shall answer your question, whether your business needs outsourced CFO services or not? Whether VCFO is luxury or necessity?

                        If you are one of those who think that your business is a start-up(s) or small or medium enterprise, you should not have a Virtual CFO, then indeed it is a myth. The concept of outsourced CFO or Interim CFO is indisputably the best option for SMEs and start-ups but is not only limited for them.<br><br>
                        The companies providing the services of VCFOs hold a wide range of professionals with extensive experience. The Virtual CFO has a team of experts in the field who brings on the table the best from their experiences. As a result of which any company who avails the VCFO, gets the expertise of multi-layered industries that provides peerless financial optimization and strategic planning.

The VCFOs hold rich and vast experience of handling personnel and dealing with the different types of people. Hence, it is in fact, quite an easy task to go hand in hand with the personnel and management of the company and achieve the pre-set goals of the company.</p>

The fact that Virtual CFO does not work at the very place of the company is least relevant when it comes to performance.

                        Often, the entrepreneurs don't find the need to have a chief financial officer (CFO) as their Virtual CFO may not match their company model. An outsourced or Virtual CFO however, can easily cope-up with the business model as the team of CFO has a diverse portfolio in their basket.

                <h3> Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                 
                  Small medium business groups especially feel crippled by the lack of capability to afford a full-time CFO and the ability for strategic, financial and operational decision making can benefit by employing a virtual CFO service. With Virtual CFOs, a company ensures continuity, and decreases dependence on one person. In some cases, the cost of a Virtual CFO can be as cheap as 50-70 per cent the cost of a full-time CFO. <br><br>
                  
                  Can a virtual CFO help you overcome your business challenges and partner with you to help you achieve your organization’s potential?

    She had always dreamed of bringing into existence one organization that may cater to the needs of best professionals from different verticals under one roof. She has always observed that various laws are interrelated in many a situation. When it comes to serving a particular client in respect of any transaction/event/situation, it has to be reviewed in the light of various laws so that while providing solutions to any client no loose ends are left giving passage to some other problems to come in, not visualized earlier. Moreover, this format of service is important because it is always cost-effective and very convenient for the clients stopping them from running door to door for varied services and providing total satisfaction.

   <p>Chandan is a Chartered Accountant who qualified in the year 2007. Post qualification he served ICICI bank, a leading private sector bank, at its headquarter at Mumbai.

He is also a very good player of badminton and participated in various state-level competitions. <br><br>
    He has over 10 years of experience across diversified sectors in the areas of government sector audits, NGOs' audits, assurances, Consulting, and handling taxation matters. He has helped clients making appeal strategies, filing of appeals before Appellate Authorities and compliances with legal requirements and procedures. Currently, he is focused on Goods and Services Tax. As the GST act is new and settling fast, it requires very special attention about various notifications, circulars, etc. on the part of professionals, he is trying his best to help clients making day to day compliances under this act.
