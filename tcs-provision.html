  <h3>
    On what value shall TCS be levied?
   </h3>
   <p>Section 206C (1) of Income Tax Act stated that tax shall be collected on the <b class="font-italic">value being debited as payable by the buyer to the seller.</b><br><br>
    Section 15(2)(a) of the CGST Act 2017 states that GST shall be levied on the value of supply including “any taxes, duties, cesses, fees and charges levied under any law for the time being in force other than this Act, the State Goods and Services Tax Act, the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax Act and the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act, if charged separately by the supplier”.<br><br>
    On combined reading of the above two definitions, it can be interpreted that both the taxes required levy on the value of supply of goods / services along with the other levies.<br><br>
    Thus, until very long, there was confusion as to what would be the amount on which TCS or GST would be levied since both laws required collection on the sum of the value of supply of goods / services and all other levies against the supply.<br><br>
    This in turn led to divergent practices being adopted across the industry wherein either of the below methodologies were followed:
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush ">
<li class="list-group-item">1. GST being collected on the sum of the value of supply and TCS.</li>
 <li class="list-group-item">2. TCS being collected on the sum of the value of supply and GST.
  </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Subsequently, vide Corrigendum to Circular 76, CGST, dated 7th March’19 it was clarified that GST would not be required to be collected on the value of TCS.</p>

    Extracts of CBDT circular dated 29.09.2020
   </h3>
   <h4>Calculation of threshold for the financial year 2020-21</h4>
<p>
  Since sub-section (1H) of section 206C of the Act applies on receipt of sale consideration, the provision of this sub-section shall not apply on any sale consideration received before 1st October 2020. Consequently, <b class="font-italic">it would apply on all sale consideration (including advance received for sale) received on or after 1st October 2020 even if the sale was carried out before 1st October 2020.</b><br><br>
  Also, Since the threshold of fifty lakh rupees is with respect to the previous year, calculation of receipt of sale consideration for triggering TCS under sub-section (1 H) of section 206C shall be computed from 1st April, 2020. Hence, if a person being seller has already received fifty lakh rupees or more up to 30th September 2020 from a buyer, the TCS under sub-section (1 H) of section 206C shall apply on all receipt of sale consideration during the previous year, on or after 1st October 2020, from such buyer.

</p>
<h4>Adjustment for sale return, discount or indirect taxes</h4>
<p>
  It is hereby clarified that <b class="font-italic">no adjustment on account of sale return or discount or indirect taxes including GST is required to be made for collection of tax </b>under sub-section (IH) of section 206C of the Act since the collection is made with reference to receipt of amount of sale consideration.
</p>
<h4>Fuel supplied to non-resident airlines</h4>
<p>To remove difficulties, it is provided that the provisions of sub-section (1 H) of section 206C of the Act <b class="font-italic">shall not apply on the sale consideration received for fuel supplied to non-resident airlines at airports in India.</b></p>

<h4>Applicability to sale of motor vehicle</h4>
<p>In this regard it may be noted that the scope of sub-sections (IH) and (IF) are different. While sub-section (1 F) is based on single sale of motor vehicle, sub-section (1 H) is for receipt above 50 lakh rupees during the previous year against aggregate sale of good. While sub-section (1F) is for sale to consumer only and not to dealers, sub-section (1H) is for all sale above the threshold. Hence, in order to remove difficulty, it is clarified that, -<br>
<ul class="lower-roman-list p-3">
  <li>Receipt of sale consideration from a dealer would be subjected to TCS under sub-section (I H) of the Act, if such sales are not subjected to TCS under sub-section (1 F) of section 206C of the Act. </li>
   <li>In case of sale to consumer, receipt of sale consideration for sale of motor vehicle of the value of ten lakh rupees or less to a buyer would be subjected to TCS under sub-section (1 H) of section 206C of the Act, if the receipt of sale consideration for such vehicles during the previous year exceeds fifty lakh rupees during the previous year.</li>
   <li>In case of sale to consumer, receipt of sale consideration for sale of motor vehicle of the value exceeding ten lakh rupees would not be subjected to TCS under sub-section (lH) of section 206C of the Act if such sales are subjected to TCS under sub-section (IF) of section 206C of the Act.

    Further clarification by CBDT dated 30.09.2020
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hats off to our Indian government officials, who are burning the midnight oil. They are providing clarification on the income tax website post 7 pm on 30th Sept 2020 for laws to be implemented from 1st Oct 2020. <br><br>
Extracts of the above clarification is as under:
<ul class="listing-styling">
  <li>
    It has been clarified that no <b>TCS needs to be collected on receipt before 01.10.2020</b> even if it crosses threshold of Rs. 50 lakh.<br>
TCS needs to be collected on amount received after 01.10.2020. For eg: If total receipt from a person till 30.09.2020 is Rs. 60 lakh and after 01.10.2020 one received Rs. 10 lakh from the same person then TCS is to be collected only on Rs. 10 lakh received after 01.10.2020.</li>
<li>It has been further clarified by the CBDT that since businesses generally maintain running balance for debtors and to remove difficulty of checking the bill against which amount has been received, it has been clarified that <b>TCS shall be collected on each receipt after 01.10.2020 above the threshold of Rs. 50 lakh.</b><br>
Thus, this implies that TCS needs to be collected on sale made before 1 or 2 years and received after 01.10.2020 above the threshold of Rs. 50 lakh.</li>
<li>It may be noted that this <b>TCS applies only in cases where receipt of sale consideration exceeds Rs. 50 lakh in a financial year.</b> As the threshold is based on the yearly receipt, it may be noted that only for the purpose of calculation of this threshold of Rs. 50 lakh, the receipt from the beginning of the financial year i.e. from 1st April, 2020 shall be taken into account.  For example, the seller has to collect tax on receipt of Rs. 5 lakh after 1st October, 2020 because the receipts from 1st April, 2020 exceeded the specified threshold of Rs. 50 lakh.</li>

<li>TCS is not an additional tax. In this regard, it may be noted that <b>TCS is not an additional tax but is in the nature of advance income-tax/TDS</b> for which the buyer would get the credit against his actual income tax liability and if the amount of TCS is more than his tax liability, the buyer would be entitled for refund of the excess amount along with interest.</li>

<li>This is to clarify once again that <b>TCS is made applicable to only those sellers whose business turnover exceeds Rs. 10 crore.</b>  In other words, those having turnover of less than Rs. 10 crore will not be required to collect TCS. There are only around 3.5 lakh persons who have disclosed business turnover of more than Rs. 10 crore in FY 2018-19. There are around 18 lakh entities which already deal with TDS/TCS. Therefore, this TCS collection under these new provisions would be required to be made by persons who, in most of the cases, would already be complying with the other provisions of TDS/TCS.

    She had always dreamed of bringing into existence one organization that may cater to the needs of best professionals from different verticals under one roof. She has always observed that various laws are interrelated in many a situation. When it comes to serving a particular client in respect of any transaction/event/situation, it has to be reviewed in the light of various laws so that while providing solutions to any client no loose ends are left giving passage to some other problems to come in, not visualized earlier. Moreover, this format of service is important because it is always cost-effective and very convenient for the clients stopping them from running door to door for varied services and providing total satisfaction.

   <p>Chandan is a Chartered Accountant who qualified in the year 2007. Post qualification he served ICICI bank, a leading private sector bank, at its headquarter at Mumbai. But very soon he realized that the knack of accounts, finance, and business laws which was inculcated in him while undergoing the courses of ICAI has got its best use in the field of practice and finally came into practice since 2009 itself. He is also a very good player of badminton and participated in various state-level competitions. <br><br>
    He has over 10 years of experience across diversified sectors in the areas of government sector audits, NGOs' audits, assurances, Consulting, and handling taxation matters. He has helped clients making appeal strategies, filing of appeals before Appellate Authorities and compliances with legal requirements and procedures. Currently, he is focused on Goods and Services Tax. As the GST act is new and settling fast, it requires very special attention about various notifications, circulars, etc. on the part of professionals, he is trying his best to help clients making day to day compliances under this act.
