<h3>Common Misconceptions About Trademarking a Name</h3>
<p>
Don’t let your pride take the same toll on you. Protect your brand and your livelihood by trusting the facts – not your gut – and making sure not to fall victim to any of these misconceptions about trademarking a name.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Misconceptions</h3>
<ul class="listing-styling">
<li>I Shouldn’t Use My Name Until It’s Been Registered</li>
  <li>My Trademark is Totally Original, I Don’t Need a Search</li>
    <li>My Competition Never Filed to Trademark Their Name So I Can Steal It, Right?</li>
      <li>Owning a Trademark Means I Own Exclusive Rights to the Word</li>
        <li>I Can Use the ® Symbol and the TM Symbols Interchangeably</li>
          <li>My Name Isn’t Identical to an Existing Trademark So It Will Definitely Be Approved</li>
            <li>Once My Application Is Approved, It Is Recognized Worldwide</li>
              <li>I Own the Trademark, Therefore I Own the Domain Name</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>
The process of trademark registration is little time consuming, but ultimately it ensures the safety and sustainability of your brand’s product or service in the long run. Moreover, every organization should consider this process. Indeed, for this, they should only rely on a reputed partner.</p>

    She had always dreamed of bringing into existence one organization that may cater to the needs of best professionals from different verticals under one roof. She has always observed that various laws are interrelated in many a situation. When it comes to serving a particular client in respect of any transaction/event/situation, it has to be reviewed in the light of various laws so that while providing solutions to any client no loose ends are left giving passage to some other problems to come in, not visualized earlier. Moreover, this format of service is important because it is always cost-effective and very convenient for the clients stopping them from running door to door for varied services and providing total satisfaction.

He is also a very good player of badminton and participated in various state-level competitions. <br><br>
    He has over 10 years of experience across diversified sectors in the areas of government sector audits, NGOs' audits, assurances, Consulting, and handling taxation matters. He has helped clients making appeal strategies, filing of appeals before Appellate Authorities and compliances with legal requirements and procedures. Currently, he is focused on Goods and Services Tax. As the GST act is new and settling fast, it requires very special attention about various notifications, circulars, etc. on the part of professionals, he is trying his best to help clients making day to day compliances under this act.
